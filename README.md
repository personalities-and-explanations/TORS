### 4. Scripts
This folder contains the analysis notebooks used to generate results for the paper.

- **Demographics.ipynb**  
  Produces the participant demographics summary and trait distribution counts used in Section 4.1.

- **RQ1_LexicalEvaluation.ipynb**  
  Runs the lexical evaluation pipeline for RQ1 and outputs the classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) by trait and explanation condition.

- **RQ1_chisquare.ipynb**  
  Computes chi-square analyses and residual-based outputs used for explanation-type comparisons.

- **RQ2a_PreferredExplanationType*.ipynb**  
  Analyzes preferred explanation type outcomes for RQ2 and generates pairwise comparisons and summary outputs.

- **RQ2b_Trait(Non_)EffectsOnChoice*.ipynb**  
  Tests trait-related and non-trait-related effects on choice behavior for RQ2.

- **RQ3a_RelatingPersonalityTraits*.ipynb**  
  Examines relationships between personality traits and perceived outcomes for RQ3.

- **RQ3b_ModelingStyleandPerson*.ipynb**  
  Models the relationship between explanation style and personality-related factors for RQ3.

- **RQ4_system_perception.ipynb**  
  Runs the system-level perception analyses for RQ4 (for example, trust, satisfaction, and intention to use).


### 5. Tables
This folder contains the paper-ready tables exported from the notebooks, organized by paper section.

- **Section 4.1 Participant Demographics and Trait Distribution**  
  Tables reporting sample demographics and trait distributions.

- **Section 4.2 RQ1: Generating Personality-Aware Explanations at Scale**  
  Tables reporting RQ1 evaluation results (for example, classification metrics and summary comparisons).

- **Section 4.3 RQ2 Personality Trait Effects on Choice Behavior**  
  Tables reporting RQ2 choice behavior analyses, including tests and post-hoc comparisons.

- **Section 4.4 RQ3 Perceived Perception Outcomes**  
  Tables reporting RQ3 perception outcomes across explanation types and trait groups.
